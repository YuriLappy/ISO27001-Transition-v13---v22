🚀 ISO 27001:2013 to ISO 27001:2022 Transition – HackTech Project

This repository demonstrates the transition process from ISO/IEC 27001:2013 to ISO/IEC 27001:2022, implemented for an imaginary small-scale product-based organization named _HackTech

📌 Project Overview

With the release of ISO 27001:2022, several structural and control-level changes were introduced, including a restructured Annex A with 93 controls grouped into 4 themes (Organizational, People, Physical, and Technological). This project showcases the necessary documentation updates, new document creation, and key changes required to transition an existing ISMS to comply with the 2022 version of the standard.

🔄 Key Transition Activities

- ✅ Review and update all mandatory documents and policies aligned with 2022 clauses  
- ✅ Update the Statement of Applicability (SoA) to map against the revised 93 controls  
- ✅ Perform a GAP Assessment to identify compliance gaps between 2013 and 2022  
- ✅ Conduct Risk Assessment based on updated Annex A  
- ✅ Create new documents required for additional controls introduced in v22  

🆕 New Documents Added (As per ISO 27001:2022 Requirements)
